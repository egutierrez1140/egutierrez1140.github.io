			<h1>Aesthetic Statement - What I Overheard On My Way Home</h1>
			<div class="box">
				<p>
					This was another piece that touched upon my struggles during 
					my last semester. This time I decided to explore the use of 
					dialogue in a more expressive poetry format. I wanted to make 
					something that had important physical significance. In this 
					case, I decided to use physical space to indicate different 
					speakers on opposite spectrums. By the end of the piece, I 
					believe that it is apparent that this individual was listening 
					to the voices in his head. I based this conversation on an 
					experience that I had when I decided to really listen to what 
					was going on in my head as I drove home after work one night. 
					I found it interesting to listen to myself for a change, and 
					I decided to add some hyperbolic personification to create an 
					interesting scenario. I am particularly proud of what I was able 
					to accomplish with this poem as far as style is concerned, and 
					this piece sparked more ideas for me to experiment with visual 
					presentation of poems.

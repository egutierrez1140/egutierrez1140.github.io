					* All criticisms for this piece were about the odd placements 
					of bold and italic text; this was due to a visual glitch when 
					the piece was first uploaded to Google Drive. It has hence been 
					fixed and resolved, and this site should show the correct 
					formatting and styling.

						See, I told you, <br>
						It's all the same. <br>
						Must you keep ignoring our bane? <br>

						Oh, come on, <br>
						It's not so bad. <br>
						Get through this and we'll again be glad. <br>

					<b>
						You don't understand, <br>
						You're a disc on a record. <br>
						Away with you, bring in the liquor. <br>
					</b>
				</p>
				<p class="rightText">
					<i>
						You go too far! <br>
						Do you not seek clarity? <br>
						We will go nowhere without solidarity. <br>

					<b>
						Look at his mind, <br>
						It can't take much more. <br>
						The advice you're giving is making it worse. <br>
					</b>

					<i>
						There's no other way, <br>
						What you seek is vengeance. <br>
						There is no one to blame; the answer is patience. <br>

						Just turn him loose! <br>

					You two are quite rowdy, <br>
					I wish you both had a switch. <br>
					The world is already cloudy, <br>
					Must you give me an itch? <br>
					<br>
					I can still see the road, <br>
					But my headlights grow dimmer. <br>
					With this thousand-pound load, <br>
					Hope is but a glimmer. <br>
					<br>
					Now shut up for a while, <br>
					Home is just around the corner. <br>
					They must not join my trial; <br>
					My inner disorder. <br>

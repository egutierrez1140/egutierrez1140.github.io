			<h1>Aesthetic Statement - abstract Poem()</h1>
			<div class="box">
				<p>
					Being a Computer Science major, I have written many, many 
					scripts and files, both for class and for personal projects. 
					Programming is my true passion, and near the end of the 
					semester, I decided to try to funnel that passion into a 
					poetic piece. My goal was to make a poem that could, in 
					theory, be compiled and run on a machine. This ended up 
					being a tougher task than I initially anticipated, so I 
					decided to take creative liberties and make the code ALMOST 
					be able to compile. I just wanted to experiment in a style 
					that I have not seen before. I doubt I'm the first person to 
					try this kind of poem out, but, to my knowledge, I am the 
					first to try this. I need to Google this once I have some 
					after classes and finals are over. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Anyway, I was mainly concerned with exploring a new style 
					for this piece, not necessarily with any big or important 
					meaning to get across to the reader. I just chose the 
					general topic of poems and their meanings and essentially 
					let my mind ramble, just to see what would appear on screen. 
					The style is based on C++ code, one of my personal favorites.

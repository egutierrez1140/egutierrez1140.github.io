			<h1>Summarized Comments For Revision</h1>
			<div class="box">
				<p>
					* Stanza 1, line 3 needed work: 'these' was ambiguous to many readers 
					and 'bright' received mixed reviews for its use with darker ideas. 
					Changing the line was suggested, which in turn could change line 4 
					as well.
				</p>
				<p>
					* Stanza 3, line 1 was too different from the rest of the poem and 
					broke rhythm; changing the format for it was suggested, including 
					using a different choice of words.
				</p>
				<p>
					* Some suggested changing Stanza 3, line 4 since it seemed out of place. 
					In my opinion, I just don't think they are understanding the image 
					of writing on paper for homework in this stanza.

			<h1>As It All Fades - First Draft</h1>
			<div class="box">
				<p>
					The cry of a child in the night, <br>
					The torment of an empty sleep. <br>
					There was a time when these were bright, <br>
					But not the flicker, as reasons creep. <br>
				</p>
				<p>
					Every day a brand new shade, <br>
					Upon the old repeated places, <br>
					And from the things he had once made, <br>
					His life, devotion, leaves only traces. <br>
				</p>
				<p>
					Trees on trees, day by day,  <br>
					Hollow shells of thoughts, emotions. <br>
					Mechanical hands that swing and sway, <br>
					Numerical promotion for human demotion. <br>
				</p>
				<p>
					The tightened grip on fragile glass, <br>
					Liquid takes its shape, and then takes his, <br>
					The rest of the world could kiss his ass, <br>
					If only he could say it, that is. <br>
				</p>
				<p>
					His cry, like a child, in the night, <br>
					He's tormented by an empty sleep. <br>
					These are the things he pulls in tight, <br>
					These are more things he struggles to keep. <br>

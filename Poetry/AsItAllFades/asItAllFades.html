			<h1>Aesthetic Statement - As It All Fades</h1>
			<div class="box">
				<p>
					I tapped into my inner depression to write this piece. I 
					wouldn't say that I have a severe case of it, but this last 
					semester has not been very good for my overall health, 
					especially not for my state of mind. So, I decided to channel 
					all of my negative and perhaps hyperbolic thoughts into a poem. 
					I tend to take a darker tone when I write poetry, and I enjoy 
					a darker tone anyway, so it all works out for me. This poem 
					was a good start for me to get the ball rolling with poetry, 
					and I actually opened up to the genre way more than any of the 
					others. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Specifically, this poem was written as I thought about my 
					last semester in college, and how it could have broken me. 
					I was lucky enough not to end up like the character in the 
					work (at least not completely) due to those close to my heart, 
					and I can't thank them enough for that.

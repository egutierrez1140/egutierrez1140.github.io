			<h1>Aesthetic Statement - The Difference</h1>
			<div class="box">
				<p>
					Deep down inside, I believe myself to be a simple man. I 
					say this because I tend to find enjoyment in seemingly 
					simple, everyday things. One of those such things is a 
					starry night. I've always found space fascinating; as a kid, 
					I wanted to be an astronaut. Just the idea that we never 
					see the universe as it truly is in the present amazes me 
					on a near-spiritual level. Beyond the great mysteries of 
					the universe, however, seeing a clear night sky is truly a 
					sight to behold, especially since pollution does a great 
					number to how well we can see the stars in cities. This poem 
					is a praise to this beauty in the night. I intentionally 
					try to derail the reader into thinking that I am not 
					literally talking about stars by comparing the sky to a 
					stage, only reveal at the end that I am just, indeed, 
					talking about stars in the sky. I was fun to experiment 
					with that idea, and it actually started out as an accident 
					as I was first writing this poem.
				</p>
				<p>
					Also, being quite the night owl, I intentionally made the Sun 
					out to be some kind of asshole. I mean, it's just a star, just 
					like all of the billions upon billions of stars that are out 
					there; it gets too much of a special treatment, I think.

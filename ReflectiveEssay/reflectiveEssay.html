					I have never been a writer at heart. Honestly, when I 
					started out in this class, I had nearly no drive to 
					write anything; I was in the class just for the credit. 
					But something changed as the semester went on, and even 
					more so when we reached poetry. When we first started 
					making original works for workshops, I was terrified to 
					take any step at all. I constantly started pieces over, 
					threw some away, and I felt like nothing I was writing 
					was good enough. Working through that first workshop was 
					difficult, but I continued moving along, and that 
					workshop taught me what could be the most important 
					lesson I have learned as a writer in this class; it’s 
					okay to not be perfect. By receiving criticism from my 
					peers, and criticizing their own works, I was able to 
					accept that I should not expect perfection from myself 
					during the first phases of a piece. Getting over this 
					hurdle allowed me the freedom to pursue my own ideas 
					and styles without the fear of hunting myself down for 
					it later. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Flash fiction was a new topic for me while taking this 
					class. Looking back, I wish I would have focused on flash 
					fiction rather than creative non-fiction. It was quite the 
					experience to see just how much authors could cram into 
					only a fraction of regular fiction piece, and I would have 
					loved to see what ideas I would come up with for it. 
					Regardless, reading some flash fiction in class and some 
					pieces online has introduced me to a genre that I would 
					like to explore some more in my own time.
				</p>
				<p>
					I do not have much to say about fiction and creative 
					non-fiction; I know that they are my big weaknesses as a 
					writer. I struggle a lot with narrative, and even more so 
					when a story gets longer and longer. That’s why I like to 
					stick to shorter works. However, since I have discovered 
					that these genres showcase my worst works, I can actively 
					pursue to better my skills in them and become a more rounded 
					and balanced writer overall. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Poetry was perhaps the most interesting genre for me out of 
					the four that we touched upon. Despite my critical views on 
					the liberal arts as a whole, I have always had a soft spot 
					for poetry and the freedom it provides to a writer. I was 
					most inspired about writing for the class when it came to 
					poetry, and I think it really shows in my work. Through this 
					class, I was able to appreciate the visual aspect of a poem 
					on a deeper level, taking into account all of the cool visual 
					tricks that you can hide in one. I wrote a lot of very personal 
					works in the poetry genre for this class. It was actually very 
					relieving to get some of my emotions down on paper and make 
					something that I’m proud of; to turn negative experiences into 
					positive ones. Poetry has showed me that I am a more 
					imagery-driven writer, and I plan to write more poetry outside 
					of class for both fun and stress-relief. 
				</p>
				<p>
					In the beginning, this was a class that I just wanted to get 
					over with; I did not expect to become a more active writer after 
					taking this class. The lessons and skills I have learned thus 
					far have given me the confidence to believe in my own writing 
					just a little bit more, and to pursue higher horizons as an 
					amateur writer. Writing may not be my true passion, but if this 
					class has taught me anything, it’s that we all have an inner 
					writer, and releasing it from its shackles can set you free as 
					well. If a stubborn guy like me can do it, so can anyone else. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Thank you for everything you have done to make this class an 
					enjoyable experience. It has been a very rough semester, even 
					in this class, but it has all been worth it.

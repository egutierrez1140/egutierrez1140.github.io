			<h1>Aesthetic Statement - The Day It Lived and Died In My Heart</h1>
			<div class="box">
				<p>
					I have had a problem with English in my classes since high 
					school. My issues with it have always stemmed from my 
					inability to agree with many of the subjective points that 
					are presented to me and my classmates regarding meanings and 
					grandeur of specific pieces. More often than not, I would 
					have vastly different interpretations from the teacher or the 
					rest of the class, and works deemed to be classics or marvels 
					of their craft would often not sit well with me. The way I 
					saw it (and perhaps still see), instructors were attempting 
					to place definitive, objective labels on topics that, in my 
					opinion, were incapable of concrete labels since words and 
					phrases can have various interpretations if the author does 
					not make their intentions clear. Continued attempts to 
					place objective labels on subjective matters regarding 
					fictions, poetry, etc., lead to me developing a severe hatred 
					for the liberal arts in general, but only within the 
					confines of educational institutions. I wrote this piece as 
					an expression of how I feel about these topics, and as a 
					reminder for the times when I truly enjoyed writing outside 
					of a professional or educational setting. It also serves as 
					a way to briefly express my feelings about making works 
					too complicated for people to understand them.

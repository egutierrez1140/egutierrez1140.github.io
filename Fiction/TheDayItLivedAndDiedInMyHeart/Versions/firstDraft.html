					* The main protagonist was not developed well enough; expand on 
					the character and provide more emotions to provide a better 
					picture of the individual.
				</p>
				<p>
					* Ending felt awkward and abrupt; provide a better means of 
					changing the ending, perhaps with the main protagonist reflecting 
					on his whole experience with writing.

					The sun had just risen, without a cloud in the sky. Of course, 
					the child did not know this at the time; he was still fast 
					asleep in his bed. A few hours later, he awoke to the crisp 
					sounds of bacon in the kitchen. The daily routine ensued. The 
					child ate his breakfast over an unimportant conversation with 
					his mother. Shortly afterwards, he was taken to the local 
					kindergarten, where he would learn new things and enjoy it.
					
					On a particular day, the child was pleasantly surprised by the 
					symbols on the board. They were not the usual scribbles that he 
					knew you could combine and make new ones; they seemed more… 
					complicated. As the instructor progressed through the lesson, 
					the child, like many of the others in the classroom, stared in 
					awe. These glyphs stood together, side by side, worked as a team 
					to deliver ideas:
				</p>
				<p class="centerText">
					C&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;T <br>
					<br>
					CAT<br>
					<br>
					D&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;G <br>
					<br>
					DOG<br>
				</p>
				<p>
					They echoed through the room, using the children as mediums to 
					move freely in the air. Over many weeks, the child learned how 
					the teams combined into organized units, allowing them to take on 
					greater tasks of communication:
				</p>
				<p class="centerText">
					<i>
						The cow jumped over the moon
					</i>
				<p>
				<p>
					And, surely enough, the day arrived when he had to create his own 
					units. With pencil in hand and paper below, his imagination ran wild. 
					The child transformed his thoughts into words, and the creative 
					process sparked an inner desire. Word by word, sentence by sentence, 
					his stories and thoughts knew much abundance. 
				</p>

					The sun shined brightly.

					The English teacher sat in the far corner of the room, reading a book 
					while the timer counted down. The subtle sound of graphite raged about 
					as students finished their works. Among them, the boy wrote away, with 
					the same enthusiasm he had kept over the years. His current endeavor, 
					like those that came before, offered him a world of his own creation, 
					a world of protection, a world of safety. Where words of the mouth 
					would fail him among his peers, words of the hand would never betray 
					him:
				</p>
				<p class="centerText">
					<i>
						… The sand crept between his feet as he walked along the shore. 
						The night sky welcomed his presence with twinkling starlight, 
						and the water washed his worries away…<br>
					</i>
					<br>
					DING!
				</p>
				<p>
					Time was up. One by one, the papers were collected. The boy turned 
					in his masterpiece and went about the rest of his day. On the 
					following day, his work returned to him, with marks of applause 
					and satisfaction. His creativity had rewarded him another good 
					grade, and with a certain reassurance that what he wrote was worth 
					writing. And why wouldn’t it be? After all, they were free to write 
					anything they wanted, so long as they inserted proper metaphors, 
					similes, and personifications. <br>
					<br>
					The sun had reached its apex, joining a small group of creeping 
					clouds. <br>

					This time, it was different. He stared at his paper, then back at 
					the prompt. The forcefulness of the task at hand left his mind in a 
					maze. <i> That approach won't work... no that doesn't match the 
					prompt... no... no.. What the hell...</i>
				</p>
				<p>
					The sun had fallen behind the clouds, and more were incoming.

					"<i>But why does that matter?</i>" <br>
					<br>
					"Well, for starters, you need to give readers a reason to read your 
					piece. The intricate techniques that you're learning are critical to 
					give meaning to your work." <br>
					<br>
					"<i>No, I mean, why does hiding the meaning matter?</i>"<br>
					<br>
					"... I'm not sure I understand. The entire point of Literature is to 
					convey a message to an audience, and to properly express those ideas, 
					you need to incorporate the literary techniques we have already 
					mentioned."<br>
					<br>
					"<i>You see, that's the thing; if you want to say something to an 
					audience, why would you go through the trouble of hiding it? If 
					you wrap a meaning with a metaphor within narrative and then 
					scatter that narrative randomly, how can you expect a reader to 
					understand exactly what you mean?"</i> <br>
					<br>
					"It's not like that. Literature is an art, and using those artful 
					skills inspires critical thinking, and then critical analysis 
					on the reader's part."<br>
					<br>
					"<i>... But those two statements now contradict each other, how 
					can you expe-</i>"<br>
					<br>
					"Look, I'm done arguing. This is the way things are, and BLAH BLAH 
					BLAH BLAH"<br>
					<br>
					"<i>...</i>" <br>
					<br>
					"BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH?" <br>
					<br>
					"<i>Yeah.</i>" <br>
					<br>
					"BLAH BLAH BLAH" <br>
					<br>
					"<i>Okay. Thanks.</i>" <br>
					<br>
					<br>
					<br>
					The sun was now setting behind the horizon, not that you could tell 
					by the cloudy sky.

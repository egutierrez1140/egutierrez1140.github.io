				Welcome to my E-Portfolio for LAIS 201. Right off the bat, you might 
				be wondering, "Why is it titled English++?" I think most people should 
				get the joke, but in case you don't, no worries, and no judgment. One 
				of the most popular programming languages out there is C++. As a soon-to-be-graduated 
				Computer Science major, I am very familiar with the 
				programming language. Throughout my programming career in college, though, 
				I have somewhat lost touch with perhaps the most important language at 
				my disposal: English.
			</p>
			<p>
				So, in a way, taking this class was like exploring another programming 
				language; learning syntax, interpreting expressions, and figuring out 
				what each "program" does. Hence the name "English++." Whether you are my 
				instructor who is going through this site to grade my portfolio, or you 
				somehow, inexplicably, randomly stumbled upon this page, I hope you 
				enjoy your time here, and I hope you can find some enjoyment in my 
				amateur English works.

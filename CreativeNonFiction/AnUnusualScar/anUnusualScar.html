			<h1>Aesthetic Statement - An Unusual Scar</h1>
			<div class="box">
				<p>
					This was the very first piece that I pursued during the course. 
					In it, I recount a very specific event that took place in my 
					childhood while my family was living in Chicago. The event in 
					question was a nightmare, one of the very few that I have had 
					in my entire life. To this day, I can still clearly see the 
					vivid images that I first experienced all those years ago. 
					Despite the somewhat horrific nature of the nightmare itself, 
					this memory is one that I think of quite fondly, due to the 
					the events that I decided to correlate with it. I do not 
					really want to ruin the twist, so I think I'll leave you 
					hanging here.
				</p>
				<p>
					As far as progress with this piece, I had a very rough start. 
					I have never been a "writer"; I do not have the heart for it. 
					During the first few weeks of the course, I struggled with 
					being comfortable with writing anything, out of fear that it 
					simply wasn't good enough. Looking back, that still holds true, 
					but being able to accept that I won't be writing something 
					amazing all of the time really helped me grow throughout the 
					semester. I'm pretty sure that this piece is more like a flash 
					fiction than anything else, but because it's essentially a re-
					telling of something from my own past and I approached it as 
					such, I shall keep it here as a creative non-fiction work.

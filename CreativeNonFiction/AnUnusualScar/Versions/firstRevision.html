			<h1>An Unusual Scar - First Revision</h1>
			<div class="box">
				<p>
					I took a seat at the kitchen counter, casually talking to my mom as 
					she went about her daily routine. I had asked her if she wanted help, 
					but she denied me such access. She kept going on about how happy she 
					was that I was visiting, joking about college taking me away from her. 
					As always, it was just another day when the memory started creeping 
					its head around a corner in my head. No rhyme, no rhythm. Perhaps 
					being around my family again sparked it. Whatever the reason, it did 
					not matter anymore; it was back to haunt me again. 
				</p>
				<p>
					...
				</p>
				<p>
					Not ten minutes earlier, I was told not to do it. She told me as I 
					laid my head down for the day, waiting for the familiar darkness to 
					return once again. the lights went out as she turned around the 
					corner, and there it was. I stared up above and reflected, imagined, 
					prayed. I toyed with the taste in my mouth as I repeated to myself: 
					I will remember, I will remember, I will remember... I forgot. The 
					comfortable veil of dark blues and purples was soon distant from my 
					perception, and in its absence, curtains of black prepped the stage.
				</p>
				<p>
					the man stands tall, his violet skin illuminating my fear. The class 
					he wears over his slim design gives him a sense of professional 
					horror. Lightning screams, and the glass over his right, beady eye 
					responds with pleasure. Closer... closer... his head crawls toward 
					mine. The teeth chatter unnaturally, without breath between them. 
					Closer... closer... His moustache gives the grin of his soul, and my 
					body receives the chill of his heart. Closer... closer...
				</p>
				<p>
					I suddenly returned to the sight of creeping yellow rays, now sitting 
					up, only realizing so after attending to my breathing. While my heart 
					rate dropped, so did the naked stick as it landed in my lap. I then 
					realized its absence in my mouth, and then my forgetfulness. She had 
					told me not to do it. I took the recent event as a direct consequence, 
					although, looking back, I'm sure that she was concerned with a 
					consequence of higher gravity.
				</p>
				<p>
					From that time onward, I vowed to never again fall asleep with a 
					lollipop in my mouth, or any sweet for that matter. Back then, I 
					attributed the sugar I was supposedly consuming in my sleep to be the 
					cause of the hyperactive nightmare. To this day, that experience has 
					not been forgotten, and the vivid image from that terror still lingers 
					in my mind. It's silly how these types of things can stick around, 
					event when you wouldn't find them as frightening if they occurred now.
				</p>
				<p>
					...
				</p>
				<p>
					Mom asked if I was okay. I gave her a casual yes. I chuckled to myself as 
					I looked down at my twiddling thumbs. After some pause, I asked her if 
					she remembered that time, back in Chicago, in our tiny apartment. Of 
					course, she didn't, not that I was surprised. Everyone else in that 
					apartment had a regular night. We laughed about it as we conversed, 
					amused by the absurdity of it all. I sat and wondered why I still 
					couldn't forget. The fear had left, so why not the memory?
